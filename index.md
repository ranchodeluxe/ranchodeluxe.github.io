#### Projects and Contributions

0. [cityenergy](https://github.com/cityenergyproject/dc): A single-page Backbone application that allows users to visualize the energy efficiency of buildings in major cities. I profiled the existing application and was able to uncovered memory leaks, zombie views and extraneous partial template renderings.

0. [osm-export-ops](https://github.com/ranchodeluxe/osm-export-ops): An Ansible provisioner for the [OSM Export](https://github.com/hotosm/osm-export-tool2/blob/master/README.md) project that sets up a development environment with Vagrant. I [cleaned this up and modified it](https://github.com/AmericanRedCross/osm-export-ops) for a Vagrentless provisioner that builds the OSM Export tool required for the [Portable Open Street Map](https://github.com/AmericanRedCross/posm) stack ( which is a cool project you should definitely check out )

0. [sheepdawg](https://github.com/ranchodeluxe/sheepdawg): An Ansible provisioner for AWS Lambda that shows an example of the [AWS Lambda Tutorial](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-s3-example.html) workflow because the tutorial was a configuration nightmare. Another example sets up a geoprocessing pipeline for raster-to-vector conversion.

0. [datefinder](http://datefinder.readthedocs.org/en/latest/): Add fixes and tests to a package used to extract all sorts of date-like strings from documents and turn them into datetime objects. See my commits [over here](https://github.com/akoumjian/datefinder/commits?author=thebigspoon)

0. [MuttSlicer](https://github.com/thebigspoon/MuttSlicer): My Python students and I like to build absurd-and-maybe-useful data structures. This repository hosts a list-like type that can apply list element methods across a slice to mutate the element state. See the data structure [over here](https://github.com/thebigspoon/MuttSlicer/blob/master/muttslicer/slicer.py)

0. [DropChop](https://github.com/cugos/dropchop): Add fixes and tests to a browser-based Geographical Information System where users can upload, geoprocess and download geospatial data. Written in Javascript on the [Turf.js](http://turfjs.org/) and [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) APIs. See my [commits here](https://github.com/cugos/dropchop/commits?author=thebigspoon)

0. [Django-Conduit](https://github.com/thebigspoon/django-conduit): Add features and tests to a Django experiment for making Views and REST API(s) more transparent and powerful. See my [commits here](https://github.com/thebigspoon/django-conduit/commits/master)

0. World Bank Group:  [Python Qt4 and QGIS Plugin](https://github.com/thebigspoon/MultipartTransformer) for [InaSAFE Project](https://github.com/AIFDR/inasafe) that converts multipart geometries into singlepart geometries with multiple threads

0. [QuadQGIS](https://github.com/thebigspoon/quadqgis): A Qgis PyQT4 Plugin Wrapper for Stored Procedure Calls

0. [Python GDAL/OGR Cookbook](http://pcjericks.github.io/py-gdalogr-cookbook/): Snippets on how to use the Python GDAL/OGR API. See [commits here](https://github.com/thebigspoon/py-gdalogr-cookbook/commits/master)

0. [FrontEndStreams](https://github.com/thebigspoon/frontendstreams): Series of examples that use NodeJS stream modules such as "through" in front-end programming 

0. [Rancho](https://github.com/thebigspoon/rancho): A Javascript framework for building jQuery widgets

0. [QGIS C++ Plugin Cookbook](https://github.com/thebigspoon/qgis_cpp_plugin_cookbook): A cookbook for building C++ Qgis and Qt4 plugins 

0. [bboxfinder](http://bboxfinder.com/#0.000000,0.000000,0.000000,0.000000): A single-page web map to help find tile seeding boundaries. See [commits here](https://github.com/aaronr/bboxfinder.com/commits/gregc-dev)

0. [jsclass](http://jsclass.jcoglan.com/): Refactor a double-linked-circular list to make it standalone and not rely on the dependencies. See [commits here](https://github.com/thebigspoon/jsclass/commit/d0f116cdbcf87601e198dea1e81a806aec619baa)

0. GeoScript Project:  GeoScript is an open-source project that wraps the functionality of spatial Java libraries (JTS and GeoTools) in Python, Scala, Groovy and JavaScript bindings. Iâ€™ve written [blog posts](http://geoscriptblog.blogspot.com/) for the project that show sample workflows processing vector data with the Python bindings ( 06/01/2010 )

0. [Django-zForms](https://github.com/thebigspoon/django-zforms): Increase the usability and readability of the `django.forms.Form` and `django.forms.Field` API.
